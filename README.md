# Adam Leacy - COMP20290 Code Repository

This repository contains the algorithms I created while enrolled in the module "Alogrithms COMP20290".

## Directorys

* **Practical 1** - Russian Peasants Algorithm
* **Practical 2** - ThreeSumA and ThreeSumB Algorithms
* **Practical 3** - Fibonacci Iterative and Recursive Algorithm, Tower of Hanoi Step-by-Step Solver
* **Practical 4** - Insertion, Selection and Stalin Sort Algorithms
* **Practical 5** - Merge Sort Algorithm
* **Practical 6** - Quick Sort Algorithm
* **Practical 7** - BruteForce Sub-String search and KMPsearch algorithms
* **Practical 8** - Simple trie string search algorithm
* **Practical 9** - Run Length Encoding Algorithm
* **Resources** - Contains the .txt documents used to test an algorithm's runtime

## Algorithm Analysis

An analysis of the algorithms I made for practicals 1-7 are included as a PDF in each directory

## Testing Algorithm Implementations 

All the algorithms I implemented contain main methods to test if the algorithm works as intended. The time it takes for an algorithm to execute will be reported to the console in nanoseconds.
The entire repository should be cloned to make it easier to test any algorithm using a .txt document within the resources folder. Some algorithms also utilise previous algorithms I implemented.

## Deployment

Run from within an IDE such as IntelliJ or Eclipse.

## Built With

* [IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) - IDE used to write and run code
* [Java 13](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk13-downloads.html) - Java version
